            Among all the creatures on Earth, human being is definitely superior. Writing a few lines or words about
            myself to introduce, I feel myself to be tiny part of this entire world that is filled with the human beings
            around.
            Hailing from a working class family, I am Rushiraj. I am simple, sweet, confident and cunning fellow.
            That’s I have learned, from the very start, the importance of passion, dedication, confidence and time
            management. My family is what my parents had worked for, ie completely happy and satisfied one.
            I am the youngest of my only brother and two sisters. My elder brother is just six years elder in age than
            me. My other two elder sisters are younger than my brother. Being the eldest one, sometimes, gives you the
            favors. Luckily, I am loved, cared and most favored upon in my all family.
            I am the students of CHARUSAT. My elder brother studies in university. One elder sister of mine is the
            college student whereas the the youngest sister of mine is studying class 10. That’s, I go to school with my
            younger sister.
            I wake up early in the morning and finish up all of my doings on exact time. We all pack up for our
            respective works. Hard work, time management, sincerity with work and dedication to purpose have
            been ingrained in our nature.
            Its true to say that a child becomes what the environments he gets in his home. All the essential humane
            qualities like sincerity, dedication, truth and honesty I do experience practically at my home.
            The college is a place that truly helps shaping one’s personality. My college is like another Godsend gift
            for me. It is one of the best college in our entire vicinity. We are truly cared, rightly educated and well
            socialized her at our college.
            I myself feel proud of being a student here. I do take care of what is being taught and what is to learn. I
            respect my teachers, my fellow beings, my college and every thing that is associated with my college.
            I am a good student, who actively participates in all activities, be it exams or extra curricular
            activities. The extracurricular activities like sports, quiz competitions etc.

            I do work for what I dream. So far, I have proved myself being the best one in all fields like in academic,
            extracurricular and in personal domains. All of this success, hard work, dedication, determination is truly
            credited to my parents who have made this possible for me.

            Successes and failures are closely associated with one’s achievements and losses. One who achieves anything
            today has lost a thing yesterday. There is no completely successful man without the mixture of both failures
            and successes. That is to say, I failed a dozen of times. But, every failure made me stronger ever.

            My family, especially my mother, has been the much source of encouragement and motivation for me. That is
            why I myself am a truly self inspired, strengthened and dedicated fellow today. I have learnt a lot from my
            mistakes and from my failures. I never regard my failure as a curse rather an opportunity to improve and to
            improvise.

            What I myself regard life is a total pot of opportunities. One has to harness one’s skills and abilities to
            the maximum of one’s capacity. For every problem there is a solution. I regard the life as a blessing gift
            to humanity. One should strive hard to improve not only his lot but for his fellow beings.
            The service of humanity is the best of all services. What I have learnt myself from my experience and
            struggles is that one should never cease working hard, be confident, positive and adoptable to all
            situations. The biggest success is that one becomes invincible. Only than, one can face the life in a full
            vigor and fullest of confidence.
            Therefore, writing about myself, I m here to express myself that what I see, what I experience and what I
            plan for my life is the total manifestation of what I do today. I try myself to be humble, passionate,
            dedicated, hardworking and honest.

            I deem my parents as being my best mentors. I have learnt the real meaning and worth of life from my
            parents. I am with a happy, focused and hardworking family. That is definitely the greatest blessing of God
            for me.
